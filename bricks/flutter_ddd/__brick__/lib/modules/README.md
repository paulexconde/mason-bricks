# MODULES

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

This directory contains your application logic and views

You can create here your features containing sub-folders to separate your business logic from the ui.

```
feature1/
	domain/
	data/
	application/
	presentation/
```

You can use file/code generation to create these folder and dart files.
